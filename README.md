Internally named wavez (wip)

What is it:
wavez is a community run tracking app that brings fisherman, environmental activists, and scientists, together.

How does it work:
wavez works by allowing anyone to post a geographic point using an interactive map, and categorizing by the following:
Fish:
	type{name of species}
	condition{healthy, invasive , diseased, die off}
	image
Environment:
	Algae bloom
	pollution
Weather:
	Windspeed
	ice thickness
	water temp	

users can share their post with social media, and browse other post both by map and category  

Wavez would like to eventually allow voting of other post and create a popular posts system that allows users to browse post by popularity, as well as allow scientists to link their article directly to the site in locataions it is relevant.


Implementaion/Ecosystem:

Fisherman will be able to share which fish they caught through integration with popular social media, as well as view maps to determine where they may be more likely to catch heathy fish, possibly even specific types of fish, or to avoid environmental/weather hazards such as algae blooms, thick ice and dangerous winds.

Activists will be able to log algae blooms, pollution, diseased fish, track invasive species caught by fisherman, and easily share data with scientists.

Scientists will be able log ice thickness, water temperature and wind speed. As well as being able to view and track the bigger picture in real time as well as archived, using this data scientists can predict where they need to be to collect certain data, and create solutions to current environmental problems.

By marketing to fisherman scientist and activists we will create a diverse community of users who produce information needed by other groups.

All of this is easily adoptable in the form of an app
Benefits:
	Benefit and adaptability are scalable, even with a low user base fisherman can adopt the app for small circle social aspects, by easing the process of sharing their catch with friends and seeing others in their area the data they create can be immediately useful as all it takes is one recording of an invasive species outside of there previously suggested zones.

As user-base grows, benefit increases exponentially. With a large user-base fisherman become able to predict where they may catch fish, scientists become able to track freshwater ecosystems on a large scale and activists become able to make more of a difference.


We think wavez is capable of changing the world
